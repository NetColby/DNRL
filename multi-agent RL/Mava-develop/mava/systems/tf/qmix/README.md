# QMIX (Q-value function factorisation)

An implementaiton of the QMIX MARL system ([Rashid et al., 2018]). QMIX is based on the idea of factorising the joint Q-value function for a team of agents and learning the weightings for each component using a monotonic mixing network whose weights are itself learned using a hypernetwork. ðŸ”º NOTE: our current implementation of QMIX has been not able to reproduce results demonstrated in the original paper.
